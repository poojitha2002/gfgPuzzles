Let the first train A move at u km/h.
Let the second train B move at v km/h.
Let the distance between two trains be d km
Let the speed of bee be b km/h
Therefore, the time taken by trains to collide = d/(u+v)
Now putting all the known values into the above equation, we get,

u = 50 km/hr
v = 70 km/hr
d = 100 km
b = 80 km/hr

Therfore, the total distance travelled by bee 
= b*d/(u+v) 
= 80 * 100/(50+70) 
= 66.67 km (approx)
