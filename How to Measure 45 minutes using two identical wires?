we have 2 sticks and matches. Each stick takes 60mins to burn. How can u measure 45mins.

Step1: Light stick 1 on both sides and stick2 on single side
            *---------*
            *---------
      Stick1 takes 30mins.
      Now stick2 will be half.
      Burn stick2 on both sides.
                *-----*
      It takes 15mins,
      So totally 45mins can be measured.
